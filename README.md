# Diamond from Diamondoid
Monte Carlo simulation for comparing diamond crystal formation efficiency using different diamondoid molecules.
## Install, Build and Run
Clone this repository. "make all" will compile a program called "diamondMC" in the build directory. The Makefile assumes you are using g++ compiler with c++20 supports. There is no other dependency for this code. You can modify the Makefile if you want to use a different compiler.

To run the program, you can type "./diamondMC input.txt" in the build directory. An example input file is provided: "inputExample.txt". You can modify this input file to control how you want to run the Monte Carlo simulation.
